================

This demos illustrates sendings simple types [integers, TDateTime, etc] and
complex types [Remotable classes, arrays] to a Server that echoes
back the value. It also illustrates sending and receiving attachments.


The Demo consists of the EchoService Server in the './server' directory and
the EchoService Client in the './Client' directory.

a. Compile
===========
To compile this demo open up the EchoService.bpg
Project | Build All Projects

b. Deploy/Configure Servers
============================
This demo has two Server Target types
 * CGI          server/EchoService_CGI.dpr
 * WebAppDbgr   server/EchoService_WAD.dpr

    Next, Finish
  From a webBrowser
   Go to http://localhost/echoservice/
   You should see the contents of the Server directory
   Click on EchoService_CGI.exe
     Expect: Default webPage
     Click on the IEchoService wsdl link
     (if in IE or NS6) you should now see the WSDL

Apache Setup
------------
  Copy the CGI application, EchoServer_CGI.exe to your <Apache>\cgi-bin directory.
  From a webBrowser

     Expect: Default webPage
     Click on the IEchoService wsdl link
     (if in IE or NS6) you should now see the WSDL

WebAppDebugger Setup
--------------------
  First run the Server to register it
  Goto Windows Explorer and run
    <DelphiPath>\Demos\WebServices\EchoService\server\EchoServer_WAD.exe
  Close the app
  Start the WebAppDebugger
  From the DelphiIDE: Tools| WebAppDebugger
  Press Start
  From a WebBrowser goto http://localhost:1024
  select EchoService_WAD.test_app and press go
    Expect: Default webPage
     Click on the IEchoService wsdl link
     (if in IE) you should now see the WSDL


c. Run Client
==============
  Run the EchoService_Client.exe from delphi
  or Goto Windows Explorer and run
    <DelphiPath>\Demos\WebServices\EchoService\Client\EchoServer_Client.exe
  In the "ServerURL" Combo Box select the service you wish to use
  Press Connect
  When connected the caption should read "Connected to : xxxxx"

Attachment
-----------
  NOTE: The attachment portion allows the Client to view a list of Files
        available on the Server. The server defaults to a '..\Data' directory
        from its current location. If you deployed the CGI flavor of the server,
        make sure to create a ..\Data directory and move a few image files
        there to exercise this aspect of the sample.

  Press GetList button
        <This will fill the listbox with the files available on the server>
  Select file on Server from "Available Files"
  Press GetAttachement
